A few years ago, I decided to live free from social media and television news.
I wanted to eliminate sources of negative thoughts that I couldn't act upon.
To this day, I'm still using LinkedIn that I find mandatory for career purposes without having the app on my phone.
In case I receive an important message, I will receive an email which is enough for me.

My connections to the outside world are intentionally limited: my wife, my workmates, my friends and Hacker News.
I know that I can count on them in a scenario I must acknowledge a very important news, and they **never** miss. I've chosen to focus primarily on the tech world, as it doesn't induce stress and provides information relevant to my job and my happiness.

It's well-known that our brains create numerous potential problems that will never materialize, which is involving a lot of stress if we are listening/reading a lot news through social medias.
But from this gigantic stack of news, how many of them can we have an impact on it? Almost none.

I really found that crazy the amount of stress we are generating compared to the potential action we can have to _solve_ this stress.
To not care is a really simple task, that is producing a lot of happinness in my life.
That's why I've made the decision to live a sort of modern exile.

There is one downside about this, and it's about the strength of my politic viewpoints which stayed the same during these years - as I don't really know what is happenning in the world.
But when I compare this single drawback against the fact that I almost don't use my phone with the possiblity to not care at all, the trade-off seems more than fair to me.
