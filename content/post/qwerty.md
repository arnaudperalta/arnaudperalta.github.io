## Why I switched from AZERTY

I'm french, I have been using AZERTY since my young age. My phone, my computer keyboards, and my laptop has the AZERTY layout, but I changed this 2 years ago for the US QWERTY layout.

Most of my coworkers and friends think I'm a nerd and don't understand the point of my change, but I will never go back again.

## Disadvantages

Here is the AZERTY layout :

For those who don't know, the third character on the top row (the one with the numbers) can be accessed by pressing the `Alt Gr` key. As a developer, I'm heavily using all of these characters: `{`, `[`, `|`, `\`.

If I want to insert any of these characters, I need to move my right hand from 2 rows to press the `Alt Gr` and then do a gymnastic with the same hand to hit the key (in case the characters are on the 6/7/8/... keys). I swear, it was tiring while I was developing.
Even the number keys are not the default value, so many strokes are needed for a developer's work.

Furthermore, I type all of my Google searches in English. Excluding the characters for development, this layout is not adapted because I spend most of my time writing things in English.

## The change

I bought a [Keychron](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard with a US QWERTY layout. Developing was a breeze with it, just the two keys `[`, `]` made the change worth it. I can type numbers without pressing the `Maj` key and as a bonus, I now have the default keybinds in games.

But I was facing one problem, I still need to speak French at my work and to my friends, so, I needed to find a way to type some characters used in the French language (`é`, `è`, `ç`, `ô`, ...).

At first, I used the QWERTY International layout. It was a good deal, I press the key that represents the upper part of the character and then, the actual character, for example `'` and `e` will type `é`.
But if I wanted to type the `'` character, I needed to type `'` then `<space>`. I was not fully satisfied.

A few weeks later, I discovered the [Compose key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key).

It is a very popular feature in the Linux world, KDE and Gnome have this feature integrated. As I work on a GNU/Linux OS, I enabled the compose key feature on the `Alt Right` key.

So, yeah, again, I need to use the `Alt Right` key, but this time it's only a few times per day and I don't need to stick a finger on it to type a character.

For the `é` character, I type `Alt Right` -> `'` -> `e`.
I can even type characters that I can't type on French layout!
For example `É`, I type  `Alt Right` -> `'` -> `E`.

For my personal Windows usage, I installed [WinCompose](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose), and thats just work. It is hidden in the system tray and I have never looked at it since I installed it.

Don't be afraid to change your keyboard layout like me, I learned this new layout in 2 or 3 weeks but only the first day has been really difficult. Now I'm thankful for having done that.
