The stack is not so boring, every services use Typescript with Hasura as a GraphQL API and PostgreSQL as a PaaS on GCP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the services were deployed across two environments on two different GKE clusters and a dedicated PostgreSQL instance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These clusters had each two nodes. With the costs of the Kubernetes Engine, Compute Engine (with a total of 4 VMs where the nodes are installed), and Cloud SQL (2 PostgreSQL instances). The monthly billing was averaging 600 euros.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You should not use Docker Compose for production</title><link>https://arnaudperalta.com/post/swarm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 00:59:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://arnaudperalta.com/post/swarm/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-using-docker-compose-for-production-is-bad">Why using Docker Compose for production is bad?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OK, that&amp;rsquo;s a bit misleading, it&amp;rsquo;s not THAT bad. With compose, you are defining your services with a simple YAML file and you can pull images from your registry.
So, with a good integration and a correct deploy script, you can have a good experience with Docker Compose on production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I say, it&amp;rsquo;s bad, it&amp;rsquo;s because you are one command away from using Docker Swarm, a simple container orchestrator, defined for production usage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About using QWERTY in France</title><link>https://arnaudperalta.com/post/qwerty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 00:59:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://arnaudperalta.com/post/qwerty/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-i-switched-from-azerty">Why I switched from AZERTY&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m french, I have been using AZERTY since my young age. My phone, my computer keyboards, and my laptop has the AZERTY layout, but I changed this 2 years ago for the US QWERTY layout.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of my coworkers and friends think I&amp;rsquo;m a nerd and don&amp;rsquo;t understand the point of my change, but I will never go back again.&lt;/p>
