At the very beginning, I started the web developpment with WampServer and upgraded to WSL2 with a Ubuntu distribution. However, I was not really satisfied as my work environnment was not fully on GNU/Linux.
As a web developper, I always found out that working on a different OS than the deployment server was very silly.</description></item></channel></rss>
